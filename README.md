This code implements a time series forecasting model for predicting the ground water level using RNN-LSTM deep learning approach in TensorFlow.

The following is a summary of the code:

•	Importing required libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Keras, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.
•	Accessing data from an API endpoint.
•	Converting API response to Pandas DataFrame.
•	Preprocessing the data by converting the date_mesure field to datetime format and selecting the required columns.
•	Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
•	Scaling the data using MinMaxScaler.
•	Creating supervised data by creating sequences of inputs and outputs.
•	Defining the LSTM model with two layers.
•	Compiling the model with the RMSprop optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
•	Fitting the model to the training data and evaluating it on the validation set.
•	Plotting the training and validation loss over the epochs.
•	Generating the forecasts and evaluating the model performance using mean squared error.
